        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a brief explanation of various parts of natural remedies, there’s no doubt that they improve our health in certain cases, however, I don’t completely agree that they are effective and a safer alternative to pharmaceuticals, nor should it be used instead of pharmaceuticals or conventional western medical treatments. </p><p>First of all, the effectiveness of almost all the naturopathy treatment methods remains unverified for many diseases they are used for. For instance, there’s no evidence that extremely diluted products used in homeopathy will have any effect. In fact, it contradicts fundamental scientific principles. It is very likely that in such cases the “improvement” in health people experience are placebo effects. Some approaches are effective toward certain diseases but are generalized to other ones by common sense, which makes their effectiveness questionable as well. For example, osteopathy is proven effective for acute lower back pain, but no proof has been shown that it’s effective for neck pain or sport injuries. </p><p>Secondly, they are not necessarily safer either. We talked about herb-drug interaction before, and how it’s more dangerous than drug-drug interactions. For instance, St John’s wort is banned in France and only available in other countries with a prescription because of its serious interactions with some medications. Although the name “naturopathy” may give the approach a harmless and “natural” impression, they are not necessarily safer and require extra precaution when consuming. </p><p>There are much research left to be done to evaluate the effectiveness of these approaches, and before that is done, conventional western medical treatments is still the preferred approach to diseases because they have sufficient scientific backup. </p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://moffitt.org/media/11193/antioxidants-lung-cancer-lg.jpg"></p><p>Herbalism also promotes the use of antioxidants, which is what I’m going to talk about in this journal. </p><p>Before we get to antioxidants, it’s helpful what free radicals are as background. </p><p><img src="http://primoh2.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fr-1.png"></p><p>Free radicals are atoms or molecules that are highly reactive with other cellular structures as a result of containing unpaired elections. They are very common as a natural by-products of chemical reactions that happen in our body. They can cause damage to parts of cells such as protein and cell membranes by stealing their electrons through a process called oxidation. When free radicals oxidize important components of the cell, those components lose their ability to function normally, and the accumulation of such damage may cause the cell to die. </p><p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/post.greatist.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/244583-Free-Radicals-Body01-1296x728-1.jpg?w=1155&h=1528"></p><p>Antioxidants, on the other hand, are compounds that either reduce the formation of free radicals or react with to neutralize them. they often work by donating an electron to the free radical before it can oxidize the other cell components. Such behaviour is said to prevent or slow the course of neurological diseases like Huntington’s Disease. </p>]]></content>

It’s also used for gastrointestinal disorders such as heartburn and bloating. </p><h3 id="St-John’s-Wort"><a href="#St-John’s-Wort" class="headerlink" title="St. John’s Wort"></a>St. John’s Wort</h3><p><img src="https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/video/wibbitz/wbz-st-johns-wort-treating-depression.jpg"></p><p>St. John’s Wort is used to treat mild to moderate depression, mood disorder, and symptoms of menopause. </p><h3 id="Stinging-Nettle"><a href="#Stinging-Nettle" class="headerlink" title="Stinging Nettle"></a>Stinging Nettle</h3><p><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/aplus-media/sc/ff73dfec-a31f-4b72-9034-61362adbbc2d.__CR0,49,2048,1267_PT0_SX970_V1___.jpeg"></p><p>Stinging nettle is commonly used to treat diabetes and osteoarthritis.

In some cases they are more dangerous than drug-drug interactions because there’s little research and clinical proof that explores herb-drug interactions. Herb products are also usually composed of more than one active ingredient, which increases their probability of interactions. </p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OSLnEOD.jpg" alt="cover"></p><p>The purpose of today’s journal will introduce you to some naturopathy practices, their philosophy, and whether there’s scientific proof of their effectiveness. </p><h2 id="Osteopathy"><a href="#Osteopathy" class="headerlink" title="Osteopathy"></a>Osteopathy</h2><p>The first method is osteopathy. It’s a method that treats health problems by moving, stretching and massaging muscles and joints. It’s based on the belief that the wellbeing of an individual depends on their bones, muscles, ligaments and connective tissue functioning smoothly together. Some techniques include:</p><ul><li>massage</li><li>stretching stiff joints</li><li>articulation – moving your joints in their normal range of motion</li><li>high-velocity thrusts – sharp and fast movements to the spine, which produces a sound like cracking knuckles</li></ul><p><img src="https://collegeosteo.com/toronto/index_files/slide_image-10-3D8.jpg" alt="image"></p><p>In UK, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on managing lower back pain state that manual therapy can be considered as a treatment option alongside exercise. </p><p><img src="https://imgur.com/tXZYwuH.png"></p><p>A research published in 2012 about the effectiveness of osteopathy (OMT) for acute low back pain states in active duty military personnel states that participants treated with osteopathy experience significantly less pain immediately after the treatment compared to conventional treatments, as well as less pain 4 weeks after the treatment. This applied to all groups of people of different age. The above image is an example of two groups. </p><p>However, whether osteopathy works for other diseases that it’s commonly used for has yet to be proved, and osteopathy isn’t always based on scientific evidence. </p><h2 id="Homeopathy"><a href="#Homeopathy" class="headerlink" title="Homeopathy"></a>Homeopathy</h2><p>Homeopathy uses products that come from plants. In most cases they are made into sugar pallets that are placed under the tongue to be consumed.</p><p><img src="https://imgur.com/N2XFEV7.png"></p><p> Homeopathy has 2 central beliefs:</p><ol><li>“Like cures like”： a disease can be cured by a substance that produces similar symptoms in healthy people</li><li>“Law of minimum dose”: the lower the dose, the greater its effectiveness. Because of this belief, some homeopathy products are extremely diluted to an extent that there’s no active ingredient left. </li></ol><p>However, according to a comprehensive research conducted by Australian Medical Research council in 2015, there’s no reliable evidence that homeopathy is effective for any health condition. Moreover, some of its practices contradicts fundamental scientific principles. For example, it’s very hard to prove why a product without active ingredient would have any effect. </p><h2 id="Chiropractic"><a href="#Chiropractic" class="headerlink" title="Chiropractic"></a>Chiropractic</h2><p>chiropractic is a method that emphasizes manual techniques such as joint adjustment and manipulation, with a specific focus on subluxation (partial dislocation of joints or organs). Some central beliefs of chiropractic include:</p><ol><li>The body is a system in which disorder in one part of the system will disturb other parts</li><li>The spine and health are closely related, and this relationship is mediated by the nervous system</li><li>When disorders in the body are removed, stresses on the body’s nervous system can be alleviated and the general health of the body will be restored</li></ol><p><img src="https://www.verywellhealth.com/thmb/pydtepd3GmdvAD2Ey7XccnJk_FI=/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/is-chiropractic-adjustment-safe-4588279_V2-620e0a488bf5435e9ac3d1c2d0740a0f.png"></p><p>According to an essay published in 2015, studied proved the impact of chiropractic for improving some supper extremity conditions such as shoulder and neck trigger points, neck pain, and sport injuries. However, for other purposes such as asthma, infant colic, further research needs to be conducted to determine the result. </p>]]></content>
